// Home screen (Page 1)
// These screen components should interact with your Firebase CRUD operations through your Firebase-related functions.

// Page1.js and Page2.js are responsible for the specific UI and functionality of your app's pages, while HomeScreen.js and EditScreen.js manage the overall navigation flow between these pages and can pass data or props between them. This separation of concerns makes your code more modular and easier to maintain.
